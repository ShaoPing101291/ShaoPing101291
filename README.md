## Hi there 👋 I am Shao-Ping Lien

 

I'm passionate about Python, machine learning, and data science.  
I enjoy using code to solve real problems and build useful tools.  
Right now, I'm learning and practicing data analysis, automation, and prediction models.

 I graduated from Yuan Ze University, Department of Information Management.

>  I'm still learning every day — let's grow and share ideas together!
